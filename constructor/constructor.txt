The issue arises because of the difference between a constructor and a method in Java.

1. Constructor:
A constructor in Java is a special method used to initialize objects.
A constructor does not have a return type, not even void.
Its name must match the class name exactly, including capitalization.

2. Method:
A method in Java performs actions or computations when called.
A method can have a return type, including void if it returns nothing.
